# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

<em>Practical Techniques for Performance and Growth</em>
Rails doesn’t scale. So say the naysayers. They’re wrong. Ruby on Rails
runs some of the biggest sites in the world, impacting the lives of
millions of users while efficiently crunching petabytes of data. This
book reveals how they do it, and how you can apply the same techniques to
your applications. Optimize everything necessary to make an application
function at scale: monitoring, product design, Ruby code, software
architecture, database access, caching, and more. Even if your app may
never have millions of users, you reduce the costs of hosting and
maintaining it.
